# uctools

This repo contains all the UC tools I've written in .NET over the years.

WARNING - The code quality is guaranteed to offend, possibly even induce vomiting in more experienced developers.  These were the first C# apps I ever wrote.  So if you start wondering "Were they written on amateur night?!"  Yes, yes they were.
